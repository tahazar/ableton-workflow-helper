# Development Loop

## One-time setup (dev machine: macOS, Live 12 Suite beta 12.4.5+)

1. Install the Live beta side-by-side with stable (Centercode / Ableton beta
   program). Keep real sessions in stable Live.
2. In the **beta's** Settings → Extensions: enable **Developer Mode**.
3. Download the Extensions SDK zip from the beta program; extract it under
   `vendor/ableton-sdk/` in this repo.
4. Node ≥ 24 (the SDK dev CLI requires it; core/cli only need ≥ 22) and pnpm.
5. From the repo root:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   pnpm setup:sdk          # extracts SDK to vendor/ableton-sdk/sdk/, prints CLI install cmd
   npm install -g <cli tarball printed by setup:sdk>
   ```

## Everyday loop

```sh
pnpm test                 # core unit tests (no Live needed)
pnpm build                # core + cli
pnpm build:extension      # bundles packages/extension/dist/main.js (needs SDK)
```

Run inside Live (dev mode, hot-loads into the running beta):

```sh
cd packages/extension
extensions-cli run        # see SDK README for flags; --inspect attaches VS Code debugger
```

Logs (`console.*` from the extension) land in `ExtensionHost.txt` in the Live
beta's Preferences folder.

Verify the chain from a terminal:

```sh
awh ping                  # gateway alive? which bridge?
awh status                # tempo/tracks/scenes of the open set
awh ops                   # list operations
awh call set.summary      # raw op invocation
```

Development without Live (any machine, e.g. remote Claude sessions):

```sh
awh serve-fake &          # gateway backed by FakeLiveBridge
awh ping                  # same commands, fake data
```

## First-build verification checklist (M0 exit criteria)

The SDK exists only on the dev machine, so parts of the extension are written
against a best-effort type shim. On the FIRST successful `pnpm setup:sdk`:

- [ ] Diff `packages/extension/types/ableton-sdk-shim.d.ts` against the real
      SDK's `.d.ts` files in `vendor/ableton-sdk/sdk/package/`; fix any drift.
- [ ] Search the repo for `VERIFY-ON-MACHINE` comments and resolve each one
      (accessor shapes in `sdkLiveBridge.ts`, command/menu registration in
      `main.ts`, manifest fields).
- [ ] Install the aker-dev `ableton-extension-skill` (MIT) into
      `.claude/skills/` locally so Claude sessions on the Mac have the verified
      API reference — the SDK is absent from model training data.
- [ ] `extensions-cli run` with the Live beta open, then: `awh ping` returns
      the SDK bridge, `awh status` shows the real set's tempo, and
      right-clicking a MIDI track shows "AWH: Hello" (logs to ExtensionHost.txt).
- [ ] Package a `.ablx` (SDK CLI), install it via Settings → Extensions,
      restart, and repeat the `awh ping` check against the packaged install.

When all boxes tick, M0 is done and M1 (real gateway operations) starts.

## Design guardrails (from ADR-001/002)

- Only `packages/extension` may import `@ableton-extensions/sdk`.
- Never commit anything under `vendor/ableton-sdk/` (non-redistributable).
- Extension file writes: only `environment.storageDirectory` / `tempDirectory`
  (a stricter OS sandbox is pre-announced).
- One logical operation = one `withinTransaction` (create-then-configure is
  unavoidably two undo steps — document per op).
- No GPL/AGPL code in the tree; GPL tools as subprocesses only.
